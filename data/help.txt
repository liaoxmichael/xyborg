I respond to a lot of secret keywords, and you'll figure them out as you go on! My prefix is `xy!`, for reference.
Here are some commands that I'll give to you, free of charge!
You can create a reaction poll by including the keyword `poll:` (note the colon!) in your message.
`xy!ping` allows you to test if the bot is truly functional.
`xy!say` allows you to literally put words in my mouth!
`xy!roll` (or `xy!r` for short) allows you to roll dice in the format XdY (1d6, 2d20, etc.). You can use other high-level options, much like the Avrae bot (keeping highest/lowest values, exploding, etc.).
`xy!answer` or `xy!8ball` allows you to tap my robotic wisdom for a quick 8ball-like answer to your questions!
`xy!joke` allows you to suffer through my many punny jokes I've stored up. Feel free to DM my creator with more suggestions if you'd like to be part of our collection!
`xy!tip` displays a D&D-related tip.
`xy!quirk` randomly generates a quirk for your NPC. You can optionally provide a name to format the message nicely.
