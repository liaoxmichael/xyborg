As its sharp claws tore through his armor and dealt him a fatal blow, so too did his blade strike true and tear the beast's stomach wide open, spilling young Enteron onto the ground. The boy was able to clutch his father's hand as the strength drained from it and his life flew down to Hades.")

In order to remember his father's bravery, young Enteron salvaged what he could from the bloody ordeal, promising to bring the corpse of the Mouth home so everyone in Corinth would know his bravery and remember his legacy. And Hera's gift managed to sustain the boy enough so that he could reach home, using his father's gifted blade to great effect and to gain undying glory. Though young Enteron was a boy when he disappeared, he returned home a man.")
